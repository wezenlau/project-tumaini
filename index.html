        <p style="padding-right: 30px;">
            We are students of <a href="https://www.utcreading.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>UTC Reading</b></a>, developing a 
            solution to Loruko Primary School in Karare, Kenya. We are extremely passionate about aiding these children who
            are living in rural conditions, where water and basic school supplies are still a dream. We felt that it is our
            humanitarian duty to help these young souls, and your donation makes a huge difference for us. Partnered with the
            <a href="https://amuka-foundation.org" target="_blank"><b>Amuka Foundation</b></a>, we have never been presented with 
            a more tremendous opportunity to express our good will.
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
        <p style="padding-right: 30px;">
            The central aim of our project is to provide students of Loruko Primary School with an adequate environment for learning,
            where the children can thrive in the success of their academic acheivements. Unfortunately, many sanitary and health issues
            riddle the school, rendering children to have no choice but to suffer with diseases such as jiggers caused by parasites living
            in the concrete floors of the schools, as some students do not have suitable footwear.<br><br>

            Another problem is that African Elephants in the local area can easily detect water and destroy the existing water tanks, leaving the children 
            with little to no water. Elephants are intelligent and get used to most attempts of deterrents used by local farmers, such
            as fires, loud noises and traps that injure them. Therefore, we needed a cost-efficient and effective way of deterring elephants,
            in a manner that does not harm the elephants in the process, as many sub-species are critically endangered.
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <h2 id="chilli-fencing">Chilli Fencing</h2>
        <p>
            We needed to find an effective, cost-efficient and safe method to prevent the elephants from entering the 
            school that also does not harm the elephants. Luckily, a technique known as chilli fencing suits all of our criteria.
            Chilli fencing is a popular technique used by farmers from Kenya to Tanzania, therefore there is plenty of local
            experience, though many do not know how it works, so we plan to educate the locals and their children on the 
            intricacies of this technique.<br><br>

            Our plan involves sisal string, chillies and waste engine oil. All of these materials are very easy to obtain for
            repairing fences, so it is eminently practical. <br><br>

            Children can also learn to grow chillies as an extra-curricular activity. Chilli-growing is a therapeutic activity and will benefit both the children's mental and physical health.​
            Locals are also able harvest the chillis and sell them, as an extra source of income, or incorporate them into their cuisine. Many Kenyan dishes are enhanced with spices, such as chillies.​
            Furthermore, this chilli fencing technique can be implemented in local towns or villages if the school project is successful.
        </p>

        <h2 id="repellents">Natural Repellents Oils</h2>
        <p>
            Our team have decided to repel this flea through natural repellents such as rosemary and lavender oils. <br><br>
            
            This oil, diluted with ethanol, can be sprayed around the room using simple spray bottles, which can ward off the pests easily.
            We plan to educate the local people on how to make this oil and to source the raw materials from Nairobi. We will also attempt
            to grow these plants within the local area to reduce carbon emmissions.
        </p>

        <h2 id="fundraising">Our Fundraising Campaign</h2>
        <p>
            The distance between Nairobi, Kenya and Loruko Primary School is approximately 300 miles. We are going to cycle,
            run and travel the equivalent distance without using any electrical or powered means to raise funds for our 
            project. The distance will be split between the five of us, which amounts to around 60 miles each. <b>Watch the video
